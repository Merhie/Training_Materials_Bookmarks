Training Materials

This is a Bookmarks Export in HTML and JSON format from Mozilla Firefox containing a collection of Information Security and IT training materials. The materials I have linked to are either 100% free, or they are relatively cheap. The bookmarks are organized into four categories:

Training Materials - These are classes and/or published training materials centered around a particular subject or subjects

Books - These are free and/or cheap digital books

Wargames, CTFs, Boot2Root, DFIR Challenges, etc. - This is a collection of hands-on challenges to help you learn information security concepts

Other Resources - White Papers, Research Papers, Security Trends, etc. - This is a collection of research papers or materials to help you learn more about trends in different information security topics and areas.
